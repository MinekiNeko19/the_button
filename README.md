# The Button
One webpage, one button

# MVP: button does something
basic standard html button with javascript causes something to change on the page without reloading or bringing to a new page
- [X] button centered on screen/page
- [X] changes the color of the background
- [ ] counts how many times the button has been pressed

# fun stuff

    - [ ] button returns to orignal color gradually (button returns to unpressed state slowly like irl)
  - [ ] next color comes from the right/left/up/down
  - [ ] gradient color change
